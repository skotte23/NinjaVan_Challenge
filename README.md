# NinjaVan_Challenge

There are 2 scenarios
1. Shipper create an order via API,
2. Shipper print airway bill from their dashboard

Those 2 scenarios are independent. The task is, create an automation project in github. The
project should consist of both API and UI interaction that is required to perform the automation
of Order creation and Print air waybill features. Participants have freedom in the language and
tools to be used to solve the challenge. It would be a bonus if you can create the automation
based on BDD style, such as by using cucumber framework.
